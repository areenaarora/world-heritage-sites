# A data project to just practice everything!

I know the title seems ambiguous but that's exactly what this project is for â€” to practice and polish some skills I know I lack on.

## Finding a dataset and self-starting
Most projects for school so far have been guided ones, or based on a prompt, at least. Now that we're diving into entirely lone-wolf territory, I'm constantly finding myself spending countless hours to just get started.
I find datasets, start working on them, reject them and begin looking again. For this project too, I spent about six.ish hours just finding the ***right*** dataset. I finally settled on [UNESCO's list of world heritage sites](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/?cid=31&l=en&&msg=session_timeout)

## Figuiring out a story from the said dataset
This relates to the point above and is the very reason I keep switching datasets. I feel confident with my data cleaning skills (of course more to learn but I mostly get by). But, I struggle with figuring out stories from datasets.

## Visualization!
The last step to any data project --> How to visualize effectively!

In a way all of this is exactly what I came to grad school for and I'm getting there with my skills --> This readme wasn't intended to be emo, sorry!
